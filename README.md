# Hello World

This is my first repository. What I have learned so far?

0. **ALWAYS remember to pull changes from the remote repository before you start working**

```git pull```

1. Add files to staging area

```git add *``` (mandatory)
this adds all new files to the local repository

2. Make a commit to the repo

```git commit -m "description of changes made``` (mandatory)
this saves the state of the files that you added to the staging area as a 'commit', or saved state like in a video game

3. Push changes to remote repository (optional, when you are ready for others to view your changes)

```git push```
this sends the changes you made to your local repository to the remote repository (in this case, on GitHub)

X. Additional commands

```git status```
allows you to see details related to the commit process

``` git log ```
allows you to see all commits made to the repository
